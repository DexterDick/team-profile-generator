# Team Profile Generator

## Description

The major focus of this project was build a command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

To ensure the code is maintainable unit test using JEST and inquirer were done on all OOP constructors and classes used to create employee data. Employee constructor was used to extend Manager, Engineer and Intern classes to keep code DRY.

-   The user is prompted to enter team managerâ€™s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
-   Then is presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer, intern or to (exit) if done building team.
-   upon exiting the application an index.html page is generated using the data enter at the command line.

You will find a demonstration of the node Js application with unit testing below.
